### Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning

#### Introduction:

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on predicting the stock prices of a given company using machine learning techniques. While the unpredictability of the stock market is acknowledged, this project aims to employ both simple and advanced predictive models to gain insights into potential future stock behaviors.

#### Key Features:

1. **Time Series Analysis:** Stock prices are essentially a time series data. The project starts with understanding the basics of stock price movement and conducting a preliminary analysis using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

2. **Moving Average:** A simple moving average method is used as a baseline to understand stock price trends.

3. **Long Short Term Memory (LSTM):** This is an advanced deep learning technique used for sequence prediction problems. Due to the sequential nature of stock prices, LSTMs are considered a viable model.

4. **Risk Management:** In addition to prediction, the project offers an in-depth risk management section. This includes calculating Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), which are pivotal in understanding the potential losses in investments.

5. **Evaluation:** Every predictive model requires evaluation. This project incorporates evaluation metrics to understand the performance of the predictive models.

6. **Interactive Tool:** An interactive module is added where a user can input a date and receive the stock price prediction for that date based on the trained model.

#### Getting Started:

To begin with the project, clone the repository and follow the and use the stock_price.py.ipynb script.

#### Conclusion :
Given the data and the various analyses we've conducted on the stock prices of Apple (AAPL), we can draw the following conclusions:
Stock Price Predictions:

LSTM :
(Long Short-Term Memory) models provide a sophisticated method to model sequential data like stock prices. They captured patterns in historical stock price data to make future predictions.

Linear Regression:
 This modelling although simple, can sometimes be effective in forecasting short-term trends but is based on the assumption that past linear trends will continue.

**Risk Management Analysis**:

**Value at Risk (VaR)** : The calculated VaR gives us a risk threshold level, beyond which there is only a small probability that the investment's returns would drop. In simpler terms, VaR provides a worst-case scenario given a confidence interval. The lower this number (more negative), the riskier the stock is considered to be.

**Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**: CVaR, or Expected Shortfall, gives an idea of the expected return of the stock on its worst-performing days. CVaR is always worse (i.e., lower) than VaR for a given confidence level. It provides a more holistic view of potential loss compared to VaR.

**Correlation Analysis**: If you have a portfolio of assets, it's beneficial to understand how they move in relation to one another. Assets that are highly correlated might not provide the diversification benefits one might expect.

**General Observations**:
Machine Learning, especially deep learning, requires a lot of data for training to produce reliable predictions. The more data we have, the better the LSTM network will perform.
Stock price prediction is inherently difficult due to the myriad of factors affecting stock prices (e.g., global events, company news, market sentiment). This is why predictions should always be taken with a grain of caution and never solely relied upon for investment.
A hybrid approach that combines both quantitative analysis (like what we did) and qualitative analysis (like studying company fundamentals, market news) is usually the best strategy in stock market investment.
