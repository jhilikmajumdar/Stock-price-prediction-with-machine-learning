# Stock-price-prediction-with-machine-learning

Given the data and the various analyses we've conducted on the stock prices of Apple (AAPL), we can draw the following conclusions:
Stock Price Predictions:

LSTM :
(Long Short-Term Memory) models provide a sophisticated method to model sequential data like stock prices. They captured patterns in historical stock price data to make future predictions.
Linear Regression:
 This modelling although simple, can sometimes be effective in forecasting short-term trends but is based on the assumption that past linear trends will continue.

# Risk Management Analysis:

**Value at Risk (VaR)** : The calculated VaR gives us a risk threshold level, beyond which there is only a small probability that the investment's returns would drop. In simpler terms, VaR provides a worst-case scenario given a confidence interval. The lower this number (more negative), the riskier the stock is considered to be.
**Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**: CVaR, or Expected Shortfall, gives an idea of the expected return of the stock on its worst-performing days. CVaR is always worse (i.e., lower) than VaR for a given confidence level. It provides a more holistic view of potential loss compared to VaR.
**Correlation Analysis**: If you have a portfolio of assets, it's beneficial to understand how they move in relation to one another. Assets that are highly correlated might not provide the diversification benefits one might expect.
General Observations:

Machine Learning, especially deep learning, requires a lot of data for training to produce reliable predictions. The more data we have, the better the LSTM network will perform.
Stock price prediction is inherently difficult due to the myriad of factors affecting stock prices (e.g., global events, company news, market sentiment). This is why predictions should always be taken with a grain of caution and never solely relied upon for investment.
A hybrid approach that combines both quantitative analysis (like what we did) and qualitative analysis (like studying company fundamentals, market news) is usually the best strategy in stock market investment.
